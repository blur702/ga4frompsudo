# GA4 Analytics Dashboard Model Fixes

This document describes important fixes made to the model implementation to ensure it works properly with the database handling.

## User Model Implementation

The User model was updated to properly follow the BaseModel pattern, which requires:

1. Using the database instance for all database operations
2. Implementing the required abstract methods from BaseModel
3. Using TABLE_NAME as a property instead of a class variable

### Key Changes Made:

1. Fixed the `TABLE_NAME` property:
   ```python
   @property
   def TABLE_NAME(self):
       return 'users'
   ```

2. Updated the constructor to accept a database instance:
   ```python
   def __init__(self, database, id_val=None, email='', ...):
       super().__init__(database, id_val)
       # ...
   ```

3. Implemented the required `_to_dict` and `_from_db_row` methods:
   ```python
   def _to_dict(self):
       # Convert model attributes to a dictionary for the database
       
   @classmethod
   def _from_db_row(cls, row_dict, database_instance):
       # Create a model instance from a database row
   ```

4. Updated methods to use the database instance:
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def find_by_email(cls, database_instance, email):
       query = f"SELECT * FROM {cls.TABLE_NAME} WHERE email = ?"
       row_dict = database_instance.execute(query, (email,), fetchone=True)
       # ...
   ```

5. Updated the service initialization to pass the database instance to AuthService:
   ```python
   auth_service = AuthService(security_service, app.database)
   ```

## Why This Matters

These changes ensure that:

1. The User model properly inherits from BaseModel
2. All database operations have access to the database connection
3. The authentication flow can properly find users in the database
4. The admin user creation script works correctly

## Testing

You can verify these fixes work by:

1. Starting the application: `python run.py`
2. Accessing the login page at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/login
3. Logging in with the admin user created via the `create_admin_cli.py` script
