# 11 - Models Initialization

This file provides the pseudocode for the `__init__.py` file within the `app/models/` directory. Its main purpose is to make the model classes easily importable from the `app.models` package and to define what is publicly available when the package is imported.

**Target Application File:** `app/models/__init__.py`
**Corresponding Test File:** Typically, `__init__.py` files that only handle imports and `__all__` definitions don't have dedicated unit tests. Their correct functioning is implicitly tested when the components they expose are used and tested.

## Pseudocode for Application Code (`app/models/__init__.py`)

```python
"""
Models Initialization File.

This file makes the main model classes available directly under the
`app.models` package namespace, simplifying imports in other parts of
the application. It also defines the `__all__` special variable to
specify what symbols are exported when `from app.models import *` is used
(though explicit imports are generally preferred).

# Import the primary Database utility class
from .database import Database

# Import the BaseModel class
from .base_model import BaseModel

# Import all specific model classes that inherit from BaseModel
from .property import Property
from .website import Website
from .report import Report
from .report_data import ReportData

# Define __all__ to specify the public interface of the models package.
# This list should include all classes and any other objects that are
# intended to be part of the public API of this package.
__all__ = [
    'Database',
    'BaseModel',
    'Property',
    'Website',
    'Report',
    'ReportData'
    # Add any other model classes here as they are created.
]

# Optional: Log that the models package has been initialized if desired,
# though this is less common for __init__.py files unless specific setup occurs.
# import logging
# logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
# logger.debug("app.models package initialized and models imported.")
