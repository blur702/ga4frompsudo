# 00 - Project Overview and Architecture

This document provides the high-level overview, architectural pattern, and development methodology for the GA4 Analytics Dashboard project. It should be reviewed first to understand the project's goals and structure.

## 1. Project Summary (from `conclusion.md`)

The GA4 Analytics Dashboard is a web application designed to fetch, process, and visualize Google Analytics 4 data for US House of Representatives web properties. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and incorporates a plugin system for extensible data processing.

### Key Features

- Authentication with GA4 API (OAuth with planned migration to service account)
- Fetching and storing GA4 property data
- Modular plugin system for analytics processing
- PDF report generation
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Security features for handling government data

## 2. MVC Architecture Overview (from `mvc-architecture.md`)

This document outlines the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for the GA4 Analytics Dashboard application. The MVC pattern will help organize the codebase, promote separation of concerns, and enhance testability.

### MVC Pattern Implementation

- **Model Layer**
  - **Purpose**: Data storage, manipulation, and business logic
  - **Components**: Database interactions, GA4 API client, data processing
  - **Location**: `/app/models/` directory
- **View Layer**
  - **Purpose**: User interface presentation
  - **Components**: Templates, frontend JavaScript, CSS
  - **Location**: `/app/views/` and `/app/static/` directories
- **Controller Layer**
  - **Purpose**: Handle user requests, coordinate model and view
  - **Components**: Route handlers, request processing, response formatting
  - **Location**: `/app/controllers/` directory

### Additional Components

- **Services**
  - **Purpose**: Encapsulate complex business logic and operations
  - **Components**: Report generation, authentication, security
  - **Location**: `/app/services/` directory
- **Plugins**
  - **Purpose**: Modular, extensible functionality for analytics processing
  - **Components**: Traffic analysis, engagement metrics, conversion tracking
  - **Location**: `/app/plugins/` directory
- **Tests**
  - **Purpose**: Ensure application reliability and correctness
  - **Components**: Unit tests, integration tests, mocks
  - **Location**: `/tests/` directory (mirroring the app structure)
- **Utilities**
  - **Purpose**: Helper functions and common utilities
  - **Components**: Date formatting, security helpers, accessibility
  - **Location**: `/app/utils/` directory

### Benefits of This Architecture

1.  **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility
2.  **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3.  **Maintainability**: Changes in one area don't affect others
4.  **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones
5.  **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application

## 3. Implementation Approach Overview (from `implementation-approach.md`)

The implementation follows a phased approach using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

### Development Phases (High-Level)

1.  **Phase 1: Core Framework** - Database, models, and utilities
2.  **Phase 2: Authentication and GA4 Integration** - Security, authentication, and GA4 API integration
3.  **Phase 3: Dashboard and Reports** - User interface and report generation
4.  **Phase 4: Plugin System** - Extensible analytics processing
5.  **Phase 5: Accessibility and Optimization** - Accessibility compliance and performance improvements

### Development Workflow (TDD)

For each component, follow this test-driven development workflow:

1.  **Plan the Component**
2.  **Write Tests**
3.  **Implement the Component** (minimum code to pass tests)
4.  **Review and Refine**
5.  **Document** (Docstrings are key)
